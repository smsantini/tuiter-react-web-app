    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <h2>CS4550 Spring 2023</h2>
    <h2>COURSE GOALS</h2>
    <p>
        This course introduces various Web technologies used to develop advanced Web based applications applying industry best practices. We start with the basics of displaying, laying out content, and styling with HTML5 and CSS3. Web pages are styled to respond to various screen sizes using CSS libraries such as Bootstrap. We program the browser with JavaScript, but quickly move on to jQuery to deal with browser and JavaScript language fragmentation. Single page applications and component based development are introduced as the modern Web application paradigm with React.js being the current most popular solution of choice. The challenge of application state management is solved with Redux. We'll learn how to create RESTful Web services with Node.js and use MongoDB as a permanent storage solution.

    <h3>Team Project</h3>
    <p>
        Students are encouraged to form teams of up to four members to collaborate on a team project due at the end of the semester. The team project will allow students to collaboratively complete a Web application from start to finish, including design & creation/optimization, as well as a dynamic user-interface.
